ABOUT US: We are a group of 11 ambitious pupils of the Werdenfels-Gymnasium. Our aim is to create a learning platform for mathematics, which enables pupils from 1st to 6th grade at a bavarian high school to practice their math skills, for free.
 Our program’s special feature is the random generation of terms, which are appropriate to the setted learning level. Moreover, the java code is suitable for every OS. The program is also interesting for programmers, because we used an open-source license.
 That means, everyone can use and process our code in a own program. Because of that our program is greatly expandable. This is resulting  in more setting possibilities and exercise types in the future!
USER INSTRUCTIONS: DANGER! Math can cause addiction!
CONTENT: The program is able to generate random terms and their  verification. You can also create a PDF-data containing several exercises. Based on user’s settings the term generation can be influenced. There is also a function to exercise with given parameters simply by choosing your wished topic and grade.
